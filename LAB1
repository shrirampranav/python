 #Lab 1: To accept an object mass in kilograms and velocity in meters per second and display its momentum. Momentum is calculated as e=mc2 where m is the mass of the object and c is its velocity.
 
Mass=int(input("Enter the Mass in Kilogram"))
Velocity=int(input("Enter the Velocity in Mtr/Sec"))
Energy=Mass*(Velocity**2)
print("The Mass of Object is:",Mass)
print("The Velocity of Object is:",Velocity)
print("Energy of Object is:",Energy)
